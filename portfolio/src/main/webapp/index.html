<h1 class="separator", id="sec: Biography">Biography</h1>
<p style="text-align:justify; line-height:20px">I was admitted to study in department of Computer Science and Technology, <a href="http://www.nju.edu.cn/EN/" target="_blank">Nanjing University</a> in September 2017, and joined the <i>National Elite Program of Computer Science</i> at Nanjing University after enrollment. I also attended <i>Vancouver Summer Program</i> at <a href="https://www.ubc.ca/" target="_blank">The University of British Columbia</a> in summer, 2019. You may see my latest CV <a href="./files/cv.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>.<br> <a href="#title">

            In Tencent I work for <i>Interactive Entertainment Group</i>, developing game client and engine. Currently I am focusing on converting game model to convex-hull physics collision model, along with detecting fissures and fixing holes on model automatically.
            The conversion process requires understanding of a certain physics engine, along with another library.
            I am capable of quickly familiarizing with them by reading documents and thus efficiently participate in the actual development process.<br>&nbsp</p>

        <li><p style="text-align:justify; line-height:20px"><b>Internship in Microsoft.</b> <small>2020.1-2020.3</small><br> I worked on enabling voice recognition feature for Office Mobile on Android devices, based on the well-known cortana module.
            During this process, I dived into real industry-level projects and accumulated experience on complex project development.
            I also cooperated with US colleagues, which not only made me get used to English working environment, but also enhanced my international communication skills greatly.<br>&nbsp</p>

    Supervised by <a href="http://mcg.nju.edu.cn/member/gswu/en/index.html" target="_blank">Prof. Gangshan Wu</a>,
    I worked on evaluating the accuracy of people doing the same action by understanding the pose information in video. To be more specific, I extracted
    joint position based on <a href="https://github.com/CMU-Perceptual-Computing-Lab/openpose">openpose</a>, then computed the list of joint angle chronologically.
    Even people who are doing the exact same action cannot have the same joint angle list on frame level, so dynamic time warping algorithm was used to compute
    the accumulated distance, thus evaluating the similarity between the two lists. I also extended the evaluation process to 3D if joint coordinates are provided.
    Under such circumstance, the body plane was used as reference plane and dynamic time warping algorithm was applied in three dimensions respectively.
    The final computed result nicely reflected the accuracy between poses in two videos.

    I completed a face image transformation system cooperated with my classmates. The basic idea
    is to use a "<a href="https://github.com/pbaylies/stylegan-encoder">styleGAN encoder</a>" which converts images to features. The features are then much easier to manipulate numerically. To mix two faces,
    just compute the average of the features, then use styleGAN to convert the feature to image again.
    Adding trained smile feature to origin feature can make the original face smile as well. By setting coefficient as user input,
    the extent one smiles or the ratio two faces respectively count can be dynamic adjusted as well, giving this project high practical value.

    I self-studied the famous computer vision course Stanford cs231n and completed the assignments, code link is <a href="https://github.com/leafeonia/cs231n_assignment">here</a>.
    During this process I have learned lots of computer vision and deep learning related knowledge, such as the theory behind neural network
    and the function of different layers, and gained a more comprehensive understanding of the domain foundation.<br>&nbsp</p>

    Served as the technical backbone of the team, I was responsible for data crawling, data cleaning and models training. The project uses
    linear regression model and
    could effectively predict the price of flats based on input information such as area, number of rooms and its position in Nanjing city,
    thus giving investors a valuable guide on B&B or flat rent investment.

    <li><p style="text-align:justify; line-height:20px"><b>HKUST academic competition.</b> <small>2019.2</small><br>
        In February 2019 I visited a series of Hong Kong universities including HKU, HKUST, CUHK and PolyU. During visiting HKUST, I participated in a Kaggle competition on predicting the running time of sklearn program and worked as leader of our team. It was an interesting and instructive competition because we could use the sklearn library itself to predict the running time of sklearn program. I did most of data preprocessing and code work. This experience provided me with a more concrete understanding of machine learning.
